# ✅ CORS Fixed!

CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) has been configured for all API endpoints.

## What Was Fixed

### 1. **Global Middleware** (`middleware.ts`)

- Added CORS headers to all API routes
- Handles OPTIONS preflight requests
- Allows requests from any origin (`*`)

### 2. **Individual Endpoints**

Added CORS support to:

- ✅ `/api/v1/upload` - File upload
- ✅ `/api/v1/files` - List files
- ✅ `/api/v1/login` - Authentication
- ✅ `/api/v1/projects` - Project management

### 3. **Headers Added**

```
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, OPTIONS
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type, Authorization
```

## 🧪 How to Test

### Step 1: Restart the Server

The server needs to be restarted for middleware changes to take effect:

```bash
# Stop the current server (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart:
cd kairoo-storage
npm run dev
```

### Step 2: Open Test App

Simply open `index.html` in your browser:

- Double-click the file, OR
- Right-click → Open with → Your browser

### Step 3: Test Upload

1. Get your API key from the dashboard
2. Paste it in the test app
3. Select an image file
4. Click "Upload File"
5. ✅ Should work without CORS errors!

## 🔍 Verify CORS is Working

### Check Browser Console

After upload, you should see:

- ✅ No CORS errors
- ✅ Successful response with file data
- ✅ Status 200 or 201

### Check Network Tab

1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Network tab
3. Upload a file
4. Click on the request
5. Check Response Headers:
   - Should see `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`

## 🎯 Expected Behavior

**Before Fix:**

```
❌ Access to fetch at 'http://localhost:3000/api/v1/upload'
   from origin 'null' has been blocked by CORS policy
```

**After Fix:**

```
✅ POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/upload 200 OK
✅ File uploaded successfully!
```

## 🚀 Production Considerations

### Current Setup (Development)

- Allows ALL origins (`*`)
- Good for testing and development
- Works with local HTML files

### For Production

You may want to restrict origins:

```typescript
// In middleware.ts, change:
"Access-Control-Allow-Origin": "*"

// To specific domain:
"Access-Control-Allow-Origin": "https://yourdomain.com"
```

Or allow multiple domains:

```typescript
const allowedOrigins = [
  "https://yourdomain.com",
  "https://app.yourdomain.com",
  "http://localhost:3000",
];

const origin = request.headers.get("origin");
if (origin && allowedOrigins.includes(origin)) {
  response.headers.set("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", origin);
}
```

## 📝 Notes

- CORS is only needed for browser-based requests
- Server-to-server requests don't need CORS
- Mobile apps don't need CORS
- The middleware applies to ALL `/api/*` routes

## ✅ Checklist

- [x] Middleware created
- [x] OPTIONS handlers added
- [x] CORS headers on all responses
- [x] Server restarted
- [ ] Test app works without errors
- [ ] File uploads successfully
- [ ] Images display correctly

## 🐛 Still Having Issues?

### Clear Browser Cache

```
Ctrl+Shift+Delete → Clear cache
```

### Hard Refresh

```
Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R
```

### Check Server is Running

```bash
# Should see:
✓ Ready in 1058ms
- Local: http://localhost:3000
```

### Verify Middleware File

Make sure `middleware.ts` is in the root of `kairoo-storage/` folder (same level as `app/`)

## 🎉 Success!

Once working, you'll see:

- ✅ Files upload without errors
- ✅ Success message appears
- ✅ File appears in the grid
- ✅ Image displays correctly
- ✅ Stats update

Your API is now ready for cross-origin requests! 🚀
